# Session Log

## 2026-05-10 Night — Play Store final pre-Monday checks (Chat Claude)

**Goal:** Audit all remaining Play Store requirements, ship outstanding code items, lock in the payment path decision.

**Done:**
- ✅ **Entertainment disclaimer confirmed already shipped** — CSS `::before` pseudo-element on every `.legal-footer` and `#legalFooter` reads "For entertainment purposes only" in small uppercase Cinzel. Added in `ca863c2`. No action needed.
- ✅ **PostHog SDK confirmed v3+** — self-loading CDN snippet always loads latest; Android ID policy (April 2025) handled correctly. No action needed.
- ✅ **192×192 maskable icon created + committed** — `docs/qc-icon-192-maskable.png` generated from 512 maskable (17KB), added to `docs/manifest.json` icons array. Committed in `ca863c2` alongside SW bump qc-v225 → **qc-v226**. Pushed.
- ✅ **Delete account requirement confirmed covered** — `delete-account` Edge Function live since May 4, accessible from Face 7 (Settings). Required by Play since 2024. Already in PLAY_STORE_PREP.md Section 10 with ✓.
- ✅ **Comprehensive Play Store gap audit completed** — full list of remaining items catalogued (see NEXT-CHAT LEAD-IN).

**🔴 CRITICAL DECISION — PAYMENT PATH (do not lose this):**
- **Decision: US-only launch, Dodo Payments on Android, no Google Play Billing.**
- **Legal basis:** Epic Games vs Google court ruling — US court ordered Google to allow third-party payment processors in the Play Store for US users. This is the legitimate path; no Play Billing required for US launch.
- **Play Console fee confirmation:** "Quantum Neuro Creations" account group enrolled at **15% service fee** (standard reduced rate for first $1M/year in earnings — applies to all small developers since 2021). Screenshot saved.
- **Current code state:** Commit `0cd3f9c` has IS_TWA detection that redirects Android unlock to `window.open('https://quantumcube.app/app?ref=android-unlock')`. This works as a fallback but **needs review Monday**: if Dodo overlay renders cleanly inside a TWA Chrome instance, we can show it directly instead of redirecting to the browser — better UX. If not, the redirect stays.
- **Do NOT touch payments code until Monday UX test on device.**

**Current HEAD:** `3049a13` (vault backup) | **SW:** `qc-v226` | **Sentry:** `quantum-cube@qc-v226`

**Pending before Play Store submission:**
- ⏳ Google identity verification — main gate, check email Monday morning
- ⏳ 12 testers + 14-day closed test
- 🔲 Monday: test Dodo overlay inside TWA on device → decide redirect vs direct overlay
- 🔲 **Create review Gmail account** — dedicated account for Google Play reviewers. Sign in once at quantumcube.app/app via magic link to create Supabase profile → then ping Claude to set has_paid=true. Share credentials in Play Console App Access → Any other instructions. (Magic link flow: enter email, check Gmail, click link.)
- 🔲 Privacy policy: verify Supabase + Dodo Payments are explicitly named by name (PostHog + Sentry already confirmed added)
- 🔲 Supabase Pro upgrade ($25/mo) — do before Android traffic hits
- 🔲 4–6 portrait screenshots on phone
- 🔲 Feature graphic: user approval → commit to `docs/`
- 🔲 Store listing copy: short description (≤80 chars) + full description (≤4000 chars) — not drafted yet
- 🔲 **External Content Links Program** — enroll in Play Console → Settings before going live. Also integrate Google API for pre-redirect info screen in IS_TWA unlock flow (code change in app.html).
- 🔲 **Pre-redirect disclosure modal** — add to IS_TWA unlock flow: "You'll be taken to your browser to complete this purchase outside Google Play." (code change)
- 🔲 **Public account-deletion URL** — static page at quantumcube.app/account/delete. Play Console Data Safety form requires web URL alongside in-app deletion.
- 🔲 **USPTO trademark check** — run "Quantum Cube" on tmsearch.uspto.gov in Class 9 + Class 41. 5 min check.
- 🔲 **Prominent in-flow privacy disclosure** — small visible line before DOB/email entry on Face 0, not just footer.
- 🔲 **ElevenLabs commercial license** — verify current tier permits paid-app distribution.
- 🔲 **AI declaration: NO** — ElevenLabs TTS of pre-written scripts = not AI-generated content per Google's definition. Declare NO in App Content.
- 🔲 **Play Console form work** (all require app entry created first — post-identity-verification):
  - Health Apps Declaration (all apps, even non-health — declare "no health functionality")
  - AI-generated content declaration (tick YES — ElevenLabs narration)
  - Target audience: 18+ (avoids Families Policy)
  - Content rating questionnaire (IARC — likely Everyone/Everyone 10+)
  - Data safety form (email, name, DOB, purchase history, PostHog, Sentry)
  - App content declarations (ads: no, news: no, financial: no, COVID: no, government: no)
  - Privacy policy URL input
  - Test credentials for Google review team (app requires sign-in — need to provide test email)
- 🔲 **Post-AAB-upload:**
  - Play App Signing second SHA-256 from Play Console → add to `assetlinks.json` → redeploy
  - Deep Link Verification tool (Play Console → Android Vitals)
  - Pre-launch report review before promoting to closed test

**🚀 MONDAY PLAN:**
1. Check email for identity verification approval
2. Once approved → Create app in Play Console → upload AAB
3. Test Dodo overlay on device inside TWA → lock payment UX
4. Recruit 12 testers → 14-day clock starts
5. Fill all Play Console forms while waiting on 14 days
6. Take screenshots on phone
7. Draft store listing copy (can do in parallel)

## 2026-05-10 Evening — Obsidian graph maximised (Chat Claude)

**Goal:** Build out the Obsidian second brain graph to full visual density.

**Done:**
- ✅ **550+ atomic vault nodes created** — numerology numbers 1-31, alphabet A-Z, challenge/pinnacle/karmic-debt/personal-month numbers, astrology houses 1-12, aspects, ruling planets per sign, Chinese zodiac yin/yang + elements, PostHog events, Supabase table/column detail, Sentry detail, edge function internals, business/legal nodes, marketing channels, Play Store requirements, ADR sub-decisions, operating rule sub-items, colors/fonts/sounds
- ✅ **Graph color fixed** — switched from tag-based to path-based color groups. White=core docs, Cyan=vault/numerology+cube-faces+app-sections, Purple=vault/tech+features, Pink=vault/decisions+marketing+play-store+operating+brief-archive
- ✅ **All 8 core docs now white** — MARKETING_PLAYBOOK, BRIEF_ARCHIVE, PLAY_STORE_PREP, OPERATING_RULES all tagged #core
- ✅ **Tags toggle OFF recommended** — tag nodes (green dots) are visual clutter, file nodes with colors look far cleaner

**Current HEAD:** `d1118bb` | **SW:** `qc-v225`

**Pending (unchanged):**
- ⏳ Google identity verification email — check first thing next chat
- ⏳ 12 Android testers recruited
- 🔲 In-app entertainment disclaimer (quick commit)
- 🔲 Supabase Pro upgrade ($25/mo)
- 🔲 4–6 portrait screenshots for Play Store

**🚀 NEXT-CHAT LEAD-IN:**
1. Boot per CHAT_KICKOFF v5.0.0 — Obsidian must be open
2. Check email for Google identity verification approval
3. First task: entertainment disclaimer commit, then tester recruitment message

---


## 2026-05-10 PM — Obsidian second brain setup (Chat Claude)

**Goal:** Wire Obsidian as the live knowledge base for the project. Obsidian-first boot architecture replacing manual project file uploads.

**Done:**
- ✅ **mcp-obsidian installed** — `uvx mcp-obsidian` via Local REST API plugin (HTTP port 27123, API key stored in config). Full read/write access to vault from Claude Desktop.
- ✅ **Vault pointed at `/Users/qnc/Projects/quantumcube`** — all project markdown files now browsable in Obsidian with graph view.
- ✅ **Obsidian Git plugin installed + configured** — auto commit-and-sync every 10 min, push on sync, pull on startup.
- ✅ **CHAT_KICKOFF.md rewritten to v5.0.0** — lean Obsidian-first boot doc. SESSION_LOG + PROJECT_BRIEF read live from vault every chat. No more manual project file uploads ever.
- ✅ **OPERATING_RULES.md created** — all detailed golden rules, command templates, failure recovery, Cursor fallback moved here from old CHAT_KICKOFF.
- ✅ **31 atomic vault notes created** — 18 ADR notes, 6 tech nodes (supabase, sentry, posthog, elevenlabs, android, cloudflare, resend), 5 feature nodes (narrate, dodo-webhook, resend-events, unlock-flow, service-worker), 4 marketing nodes. All tagged + wiki-linked to hub docs.
- ✅ **Obsidian graph configured** — dark mode, AnuPpuccin theme, 3D Graph plugin, color groups (white=core, purple=tech/features, pink=decisions/reference), filters exclude non-markdown folders.
- ✅ **Vercel downgraded** — Pro → Hobby (free). Was billing ~$47/cycle for unused Academy project. Stopped.
- ✅ **Google Play email clarified** — generic onboarding email, NOT identity verification approval. Still waiting on that.

**Current HEAD:** `c26ea4e` | **SW:** `qc-v225`

**Pending (unchanged from morning session):**
- ⏳ Google identity verification email
- ⏳ 12 Android testers recruited
- 🔲 In-app entertainment disclaimer
- 🔲 Supabase Pro upgrade ($25/mo)
- 🔲 4–6 portrait screenshots for Play Store

**🚀 NEXT-CHAT LEAD-IN:**
1. Boot per CHAT_KICKOFF v5.0.0 — Obsidian must be open.
2. Waiting on Google identity verification — check email first.
3. First real task: entertainment disclaimer (quick commit) or tester recruitment message.

Live working narrative across chats. Append-only. Each session adds a new entry **early** in the work (after the first non-trivial action), then updates it incrementally. This survives tools-drops, Mac permission prompts, browser crashes — anything that wipes the chat without wiping git.

Format per entry: date stamp, one-line goal, bulleted actions, open questions, what's next. Terse. This is for the next-chat-Claude, not a journal.

For older completed-and-committed history, see `BRIEF_ARCHIVE.md`.

## 2026-05-10 — Brand polish + Google Play Store setup (Chat Claude)

**Goal:** Pre-Play-Store app polish, full Play Store submission preparation, Google Play developer account creation, Android TWA build + assetlinks wired.

**Done in this chat:**

- ✅ **Brand cyan updated #7dd4fc → #0cc0df** across entire `app.html` — 75 replacements covering hover states, glows, box-shadows, cube face borders, face label cards, all interactive button hovers, and all 5 Vimeo `color=` params (commit `af5a3f3`, qc-v223 → qc-v224). CSS `--glow` variable now points to the new cyan so all referencing selectors inherit automatically.
- ✅ **Privacy policy updated** — added PostHog (EU, anonymous usage events) and Sentry (EU, error/crash data) to service providers list; effective date updated 24 Apr → 9 May 2026 (commit `0db433f`). Live at `https://quantumcube.app/privacy` — Play Store ready.
- ✅ **TWA detection + Android payment redirect** (commit `0cd3f9c`, qc-v224 → qc-v225): `IS_TWA` const (triple detection: `document.referrer` startsWith `android-app://`, `sessionStorage`, URL param `utm_source=android-twa`). `unlock()` now short-circuits to `window.open('https://quantumcube.app/app?ref=android-unlock')` on Android — zero Play Billing required, zero policy risk. Web unlock flow completely unchanged. Supabase `has_paid` flag means existing paid web users open the Android app already unlocked.
- ✅ **`assetlinks.json` wired with real SHA-256** (commit `d298804`): `app.quantumcube.twa` + keystore fingerprint `14:01:92:A5:20:FC:99:8F:03:07:2C:0E:69:3B:EC:04:18:5F:30:DA:14:07:BF:61:6E:C8:E1:12:F9:F7:9B:3D`. Verified live on `https://quantumcube.app/.well-known/assetlinks.json`.
- ✅ **PLAY_STORE_PREP.md / PLAY_STORE_CHECKLIST.md created** (commit `9ed130b`, Claude Code) — comprehensive Play Store submission checklist with 2026 Google policies cited, ~80 yes/no items, payment strategy analysis, all risks documented.
- ✅ **AAB + APK built by Claude Code** — `android/app-release-bundle.aab` (1.66 MB), `android/app-release-signed.apk` (1.62 MB). Keystore: `android/quantumcube.keystore` (2.7 KB), validity 10,000 days (~27 years). Target SDK 35, compile SDK 36. Keystore password saved to Apple Passwords ("Quantum Cube Android Keystore"). `.gitignore` protects keystore + build outputs; `twa-manifest.json` + `scripts/build-twa.mjs` committed for rebuild.
- ✅ **Google Play developer account created** — Quantum Neuro Creations, personal account, Account ID `9099327495444765719`, `quantumneurocreations@gmail.com`. $25 fee paid. Identity documents + bank statement uploaded for verification. 14-day closed testing gate clock started May 10 → production access request eligible ~May 24.
- ✅ **Play Console configured** — developer name "Quantum Neuro Creations", website `https://quantumcube.app`, payments profile: Computer Software, "QUANTUM CUBE" statement name, in-app purchases (not paid apps).
- ✅ **Feature graphic created** — 1024×500 PNG (Play Store spec), Milky Way space photo background, Cinzel Decorative font (real Google Fonts via Puppeteer), wireframe neon cyan cube (multi-pass glow), tagline + descriptor. File: `quantum-cube-feature-graphic.png`.

**Commits (this session):**
- `af5a3f3` — style: update brand cyan #7dd4fc → #0cc0df across app (buttons, glows, cube, Vimeo); bump qc-v224
- `0db433f` — legal: privacy policy — add PostHog + Sentry to service providers, update effective date
- `0cd3f9c` — feat(android): TWA detection — redirect unlock to website on Android, no Play Billing required; bump qc-v225
- `d298804` — feat(android): assetlinks.json — real SHA-256 fingerprint from production keystore (app.quantumcube.twa)
- `9ed130b` — docs: add PLAY_STORE_PREP.md — strict first-try-approval checklist with 2026 policies cited (Claude Code)

**Current HEAD:** `d298804` | **SW:** `qc-v225` | **Sentry:** `quantum-cube@qc-v225`

**Pending / waiting:**
- ⏳ Google identity verification (1–3 business days — unlocks "Create app" in Play Console)
- ⏳ 12 testers needed for closed testing track — recruit friends/family with Android phones, 14-day gate
- ⏳ Play App Signing SHA-256 — Google generates their own upload key after first AAB upload; add as second fingerprint in `assetlinks.json`
- ⏳ Data safety form + content rating questionnaire (in Play Console once app entry created)
- 🔲 In-app entertainment disclaimer — short "for entertainment purposes only" note somewhere visible (Google "impossible functionality" risk for astrology/numerology)
- 🔲 Supabase Pro plan upgrade — flagged: free tier auto-pauses projects with no traffic for 7 days. Live paying-customer app = production blocker risk at $25/month. Also unlocks custom auth domain (`auth.quantumcube.app` → fixes ugly OAuth sign-in URL).
- 🔲 4–6 portrait screenshots of live app (user's phone) for Play Store listing
- 🔲 Feature graphic: user to approve final version, then copy to `docs/` + commit

**🚀 NEXT-CHAT LEAD-IN:**
1. Boot per `CHAT_KICKOFF.md`. Check `d298804` is still HEAD.
2. **Check email** — Google identity verification approval unblocks everything. When approved: go to Play Console → Create app → walk through setup.
3. **Tester recruitment** — if 12 testers not yet recruited, draft message and send today. Counter visible in Play Console → Testing → Closed testing.
4. **In-app entertainment disclaimer** — add a small line to the app. Suggest: add to the profile form page or settings area. Quick commit.
5. **Supabase Pro upgrade** — do this before any significant traffic. One-click in Supabase dashboard.
6. **Screenshots** — take 4–6 portrait screenshots on phone, have ready for Play Console store listing.

**Pre-existing operational notes:**
- Android keystore: `~/Projects/quantumcube/android/quantumcube.keystore` — password in Apple Passwords
- Package name: `app.quantumcube.twa` — permanent, never changes
- SHA-1: `B4:AB:EA:5B:C2:23:41:45:E4:11:0E:AD:06:D8:7C:16:C3:ED:9C:76` (some tools need this)
- ElevenLabs: `eleven_turbo_v2_5`, stability 0.5, similarity_boost 0.75, speed 1.15 (welcome.mp3: speed 1.0)
- Claude Code at `~/Projects/quantumcube`, `scripts/build-twa.mjs` is the AAB rebuild script

## 2026-05-09 — Narration audit & full re-record pass (Claude Code)

**Goal:** Finish the narration-fix workstream queued from May 8: fix the audit tool, audit all 385 MP3s for issues, regenerate every flagged file at the correct ElevenLabs settings, ship.

**Done in this chat (Claude Code, terminal):**

- ✅ **claudewatch MCP installed** (surgical — MCP entry only, no global rule files; binary at `~/.local/bin/claudewatch`). Cache bumped qc-v212 → qc-v213 in the same commit chain. Tools-list now shows ~30 claudewatch.* analytics tools alongside the prior 20 servers.
- ✅ **`docs/audit-narration.html` actually working.** Root cause: an unescaped single quote inside the textarea `placeholder` attribute was silently breaking HTML parsing on every browser, leaving the page blank with no console error. Fixed via `&apos;` escapes (commit `ed04840`). Added a SW bypass for `audit-narration.html` so a fresh copy is always served (commit `9aec413`) — needed because debugging cached failures was burning time.
- ✅ **Audit completed end-to-end.** Of 385 MP3s, **98 flagged** for re-record (Life Phase pause-before-number, Birthday prefix, Karmic Lesson awkward digits, etc.).
- ✅ **Three rerecord passes to find the correct ElevenLabs settings** (story preserved here because it cost real credits):
  1. **Pass 1 — speed 0.85.** Source: ElevenLabs dashboard's saved voice profile (`/v1/voices/<id>` returned `speed: 0.85`). Wrong — too slow vs the untouched 287 originals.
  2. **Pass 2 — speed 1.0.** Closer but still noticeably slower than the rest of the library.
  3. **Pass 3 — speed 1.15.** Found by `git log -p --pickaxe-regex -S speed -- supabase/functions/narrate/`: commits `f7854ee` (256 MP3 bulk gen) and `be9f385` (phase 2 generation) both had the narrate Edge Function hard-coded at `speed: 1.15` at the time the originals were recorded. **This is the correct production setting.** `similarity_boost` was also wrong on disk (0.51 vs original 0.75) — corrected in the same pass.
- ✅ **Script transformations for stubborn TTS.** Ran each fix as a TTS-payload-only rewrite (manifest text untouched, app UI unchanged):
  - **Life Phase 2-9** (`num_pc_<n>_v1.mp3`): "A 2 Life Phase marks…" → "A Life Phase governed by the 2 marks…" (kills the awkward pause before the number).
  - **Birthday 1-9, 11, 22**: scripts already had "Birthday Number" prefix. Confirmed and shipped as-is.
  - **Karmic Lesson 1-9** (`num_kl_*`): digit spelled out — "A Karmic Lesson 1" → "A Karmic Lesson One". Same pattern for 2/3/4/5/6/7/9.
  - **Hidden Passion 4 & 6** (`num_hp_4_v3`, `num_hp_6_v3`): digit was being swallowed entirely. Spelled out + comma-padded + finally em-dash-padded for hp_6 ("The Hidden Passion — Six —"). Three passes to crack hp_6 specifically.
  - **chin_ox_core**: "Ox" rendered as just "ssss". TTS payload now uses phonetic respelling "Ocks" for all three occurrences. Manifest text stays "Ox".
- ✅ **`scripts/rerecord.py` shipped** — single-purpose Python script that reads the manifest from `audit-narration.html`, applies the named transforms, POSTs to ElevenLabs direct, writes MP3s + emits SHA256 JSON for manifest update. Lives at `scripts/rerecord.py` for any future per-file re-records.
- ✅ **Numerology Matrix description card added to `docs/app.html`** — non-interactive `.matrix-desc` static card sits directly below the 3×3 matrix grid, explains what the matrix is. Same border/glass/inset-glow as the icard pattern, no cursor or click handler.
- ✅ **Per-key ElevenLabs quota raised twice** mid-session (200K → 400K) when the rerecord burned through the per-key character cap. Account-level pool was fine; the `Quantum Cube` key's own limit needed lifting in the dashboard.

**Commits (chronological, this session, after `ed04840`):**

- `e0f3c79` — feat(narration): regenerate 98 MP3s; Life Phase pause fix, Birthday prefix
- `b78bf86` — chore: bump cache qc-v213 → qc-v214
- `6d8af3b` — feat(narration): regenerate 98 MP3s at speed 1.0; bump qc-v214 → v215
- `3161400` — feat(matrix): add static description card below numerology matrix; bump v215 → v216
- `cec69b0` — feat(narration): regenerate 98 MP3s at original settings (sb 0.75, speed 1.15); bump v216 → v217
- `4bc30f3` — feat(narration): re-record 20 MP3s; spell out Karmic Lesson digit; bump v217 → v218
- `c19d19f` — feat(narration): re-record 3 MP3s (hp_4, hp_6, ox); bump v218 → v219
- `cb1628e` — feat(narration): re-record same 3 MP3s again; bump v219 → v220
- `4064ae4` — fix(narration): phonetic fixes for hp_4/hp_6 (digit→word) and ox (Ox→Ocks); bump v220 → v221
- `46f7994` — fix(narration): hp_6 comma-pad 'Six'; bump v221 → v222
- `29eece7` — fix(narration): hp_6 em-dash 'Six' to break Passion-Six phonetic merge; bump v222 → v223

**In progress:**
- _(Listening pass on hp_6 v223 outstanding from user — em-dash fix may still drop the digit. Fallback plan: "The Hidden Passion of Six" or "Number Six".)_

**Open questions / decisions pending:**
- _(none beyond hp_6 confirmation above)_

**🚀 NEXT-CHAT LEAD-IN:**
1. Boot per `CHAT_KICKOFF.md` v4.3.0.
2. **Listen to hp_6 at qc-v223 first thing.** If the digit is still swallowed, tweak `rerecord.py` Hidden Passion transform to "The Hidden Passion of Six" (preposition-bridge), regenerate, ship.
3. **Narration pipeline is otherwise complete** — all 385 MP3s at the correct production settings, manifests in sync, audit tool live for any future regression.
4. **App polish + Play Store TWA still pending** (target was Sunday May 10 — slipping; keystore + assetlinks SHA-256 still need real values).

**Pre-existing operational notes:**
- HEAD: `29eece7` → will update after this handoff commit
- SW: `qc-v223`. Sentry release: `quantum-cube@qc-v223`. Pre-commit hook validates sync.
- ElevenLabs key (`Quantum Cube`) per-key cap now 400K; account pool healthy.
- `scripts/rerecord.py` is the canonical re-record tool — edit `FILES` + transforms, dry-run, generate.


## 2026-05-08 evening/night — Chrome audit sweep + Claude Code setup

**Goal:** Chrome tabs safety/efficiency audit + Claude Code installation + full tool setup.

**Done in this chat:**
- ✅ `docs/manifest.json` TWA audit — added `id: "/app"` for stable PWA identity (commit `4b69936`)
- ✅ **Claude.ai settings audit** — Instructions for Claude field populated (persistent prefs across all chats), Discovery toggle OFF, Cloudflare Developer Platform disconnected (redundant), Privacy verified (training OFF, location OFF)
- ✅ **Supabase audit** — advisors clean (0 performance, 1 known false-positive re: password auth), RLS verified on both public tables, 6 edge functions confirmed ACTIVE. Stale unconfirmed auth user `admin@qncacademy.com` deleted (created Apr 21, never confirmed). auth.users: 8, all confirmed.
- ✅ **Sentry/Clarity CSP fix** (commit `da02bc3`, qc-v212) — Previous chat wired Clarity but only whitelisted `www.clarity.ms` in script-src. Clarity CDN (`scripts.clarity.ms`) was blocked → Sentry `JAVASCRIPT-6`. Fixed: `*.clarity.ms` wildcard across all 10 pages with CSP meta tags. JAVASCRIPT-6 resolved.
- ✅ **PostHog audit** — SDK doctor healthy, 3 insights configured, ingestion alive (6 events/2 days). No action needed.
- ✅ **Claude Code installed** — v2.1.133 via native installer, Opus 4.7 (1M context), Claude Max plan, `~/Projects/quantumcube`
- ✅ **Claude Code configured** (commits `347afb6`, `55f72fc`, `efc4a66`, `2ab95a0`):
  - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — global prefs (buddy tone, autonomy, upgrading mindset)
  - `.claude/commands/` — `/project:health-check`, `/project:pre-ship`, `/project:narration-fix`
  - `.claude/settings.json` — PostToolUse hook warns on SW/APP version mismatch
  - `.mcp.json` cleared (project-level remote SSE MCPs conflict with claude.ai connectors)
- ✅ **User MCPs added to Claude Code** (global scope): ElevenLabs (24 tools), Context7 (2 tools), Tavily (5 tools)
- ✅ **20 MCP servers total** in Claude Code: 3 user MCPs + 17 claude.ai connectors (GitHub 41, Supabase 29, Sentry 22, Resend 32, Linear 33, etc.)
- ✅ Extra usage enabled on Claude.ai ($20/month limit)

**Key architectural insight (ADR-020):** Remote SSE MCPs (Supabase/Sentry/PostHog hosted URLs) cannot run from local Claude Code — Anthropic policy blocks persistent SSE from local machines. Solution: claude.ai connectors auto-sync to Claude Code when authenticated with Max plan. No project-level MCP config needed for cloud services.

**Division of labour going forward:**
- **Claude Code (terminal):** file edits, git, bash, deploys, narration regeneration via ElevenLabs MCP
- **Claude Chat (web):** planning, PostHog analytics, Sentry investigation, browser automation

**In progress:**
- _(nothing uncommitted — all shipped)_

**Open questions / decisions pending:**
- _(none)_

**🚀 NEXT-CHAT LEAD-IN:**
1. **Boot as usual** per CHAT_KICKOFF.md v4.3.0. Read this SESSION_LOG after PROJECT_BRIEF v43.
2. **Narration fix is the immediate coding task** — start in Claude Code terminal: `/project:narration-fix`. This loads context and reads the Edge Function. The audit tool at `/audit-narration.html` needs a bug fix first (user reported it's not working well). Fix the audit tool → user flags bad MP3s → Claude Code regenerates flagged files via ElevenLabs MCP with corrected phonetics → replace files.
3. **Play Store TWA** — target was Sunday May 10. Steps: generate Android keystore via Bubblewrap, get real SHA-256 for `/.well-known/assetlinks.json`, build `.aab`, submit to Play Console.

**Pre-existing operational notes:**
- HEAD: `2ab95a0` → will update after handoff commit
- SW: `qc-v212`. Pre-commit hook validates sync.
- Sentry: 0 unresolved issues.
- auth.users: 8 (all confirmed, no stale records).
- Claude Code: active at v2.1.133. Run `claude` from `~/Projects/quantumcube`.


## 2026-05-08 PM — Stack-upgrade sweep + process hardening

**Goal:** Continue the May 8 stack audit. User flagged: previous chat (titled "System upgrade") got disrupted by a Mac permission prompt + Claude Desktop restart. Recovered context from git commits + DECISIONS.md (ADR-017). Then user asked Claude to bring its own ideas for further upgrades instead of always being the recipient of his.

**Done in this chat:**
- ✅ Resend dedicated key created (`quantum-cube-dodo-webhook`, id `5b36c8df-645e-4a77-bc25-a060ad22b161`) — saved in user's Apple Passwords
- ✅ `RESEND_API_KEY` set as Supabase Edge Function secret (digest `02d1cd31...`) — unblocks welcome email pipeline shipped this morning in commit `14e4210`
- ✅ Key validated: domain `quantumcube.app` reachable, "Quantum Cube Customers" audience reachable
- ✅ UptimeRobot monitor `803021425` "QC — Narrate (Edge Function)" — keyword check on `Method not allowed`, alerts when missing
- ✅ Memory edit added: user prefers verbal/speech-to-text — never use `ask_user_input_v0` option pickers
- ✅ Canonical skill `.claude/skills/quantum-cube/SKILL.md` bumped 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 — added §2.6 no-option-pickers, §2.7 proactive inline suggestions, §2.8 SESSION_LOG protocol (commit `094cb78`)
- ✅ `SESSION_LOG.md` created (this file)
- ✅ **Resend bounce/complaint → Sentry pipeline shipped** (commit `723b2d5`) — new Edge Function `resend-events`, webhook `2a5c62b4-7e5c-42eb-bdeb-fbe56bcdc8f9`, signing secret stored as `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Closes the Resend-webhooks-NONE-configured gap from PROJECT_BRIEF.md.
- ✅ **Status page rebranded as "Quantum Cube — Status"** at `https://stats.uptimerobot.com/azO4bPUJJQ` — logo (qc-icon-192.png) + favicon (qc-favicon-32.png) uploaded, homepage URL set to https://quantumcube.app, auto-add-monitors stays ON
- ✅ **PostHog narrate instrumentation shipped** (commit `e5467d5`, qc-v210→v211) — `narrate_api_requested`, `narrate_api_succeeded`, `narrate_api_failed`, `narrate_audio_played` events added to `fetchNarration()` and `startNarrationFromUrl()`. Now we can measure narration success rate, API latency, and validate the upcoming narration fix against real before/after metrics.
- ✅ **PostHog insight "Narrate — API health" created and favorited** — https://eu.posthog.com/project/172921/insights/buiaXjHa (short_id `buiaXjHa`, id 4114564). 14-day Trends line graph of all four narrate_* events. Tagged `narrate`, `api-health`, `qc-v211`.
- ✅ **PostHog insight "Narrate — API latency (p50 / p95 / p99)" created and favorited** — https://eu.posthog.com/project/172921/insights/AHB7Ci6u (short_id `AHB7Ci6u`, id 4114617). 14-day Trends line graph of latency_ms percentiles from `narrate_api_succeeded`. Tagged `narrate`, `latency`, `qc-v211`.
- ✅ **Project annotation marking qc-v211 deploy** at 2026-05-08T12:00:00Z — marker will appear on every PostHog chart so the before/narration-fix-after split is visible.

*(Briefly created a "Quantum Cube — Narrate Health" dashboard to group both insights, then deleted it: the available PostHog MCP tools don't support attaching insights to a dashboard programmatically (no `insight-update` exposed via tool_search), and an empty pinned dashboard is worse UX than two favorited insights. Both insights are findable via the PostHog Insights menu's Favorites filter.)*

**In progress:**
- _(none — all live work for this chat is shipped and pushed; HEAD at `e26d591`)_

**Skipped (user agreed to defer):**
- Weekly digest email (user prefers daily review)
- PostHog feature flags + first A/B test (later)
- "First 1000 customers" Resend templates playbook (later)
- Vercel preview deploys (Claude reconsidered — architecture mismatch, see ADR-018)
- UptimeRobot CNAME (`status.quantumcube.app`) — paid-only on UptimeRobot, default `stats.uptimerobot.com/azO4bPUJJQ` URL is fine
- Custom "Narrate Health" PostHog dashboard — PostHog MCP doesn't expose `insight-update` cleanly; two favorited insights are sufficient (see ADR-018)

**Open questions / decisions pending:**
- _(none — all questions from earlier in the session resolved before doc-update commit)_

**Doc-update transition pack (committed at end of this chat):**
- `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` v41 → v42 — added v42 update note, bumped Edge Functions count 5 → 6, added `resend-events` subsection, added webhook → Sentry paragraph in Email Infrastructure
- `DECISIONS.md` — added ADR-018 covering all PM work (Resend webhook, narrate analytics, Vercel skip, skill v1.1.0)
- `CHAT_KICKOFF.md` v4.1.0 → v4.2.0 — added `SESSION_LOG.md` to the read-in-order doc system, updated boot footer to read brief THEN session log
- `SESSION_LOG.md` (this file) — final polish for clean handoff

**🚀 NEXT-CHAT LEAD-IN (start here):**

1. **Boot sequence as usual** — run `tool_search` calls per `CHAT_KICKOFF.md` v4.2.0 BOOT STEP 1, smoke-test loaded tools (BOOT STEP 2), health-check (BOOT STEP 3). Then read `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` v42 and this file.

2. **First proactive task: 60-second `docs/manifest.json` audit against Google Play TWA requirements.** Target: Google Play submission Sunday May 10 (~2 days out). Specifically grep for / verify:
   - 512×512 `maskable` icon entry (`purpose: "any maskable"` or `purpose: "maskable"` separate entry)
   - `display: "standalone"` or `"fullscreen"` (TWA requires this; `"browser"` would block Play approval)
   - `start_url` is a valid same-origin path
   - `theme_color` and `background_color` set (Play uses these for splash)
   - `name` (full ≤ 45 chars for Play listing) and `short_name` (≤ 12 chars for Android home screen)
   - `scope` set to `/` or app-root
   - `id` field present (recommended for stable PWA identity)

   Report findings back inline, then ship a single commit if anything's missing. Existing `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` placeholder still needs the real keystore SHA-256 — that's a separate step user needs to do at signing time, not chat-side.

3. **Then onto the narration-fix workstream.** Telemetry is now waiting (qc-v211 instrumentation + 2 PostHog insights + project annotation). Whatever the fix turns out to be, the before/after will be measurable on `https://eu.posthog.com/project/172921/insights/buiaXjHa` and `/AHB7Ci6u`.

**Pre-existing operational notes for next-chat-Claude:**
- HEAD: `e26d591` (post doc-update commit will bump this)
- Live SW: `qc-v211`. Sentry release: `quantum-cube@qc-v211`. Pre-commit hook validates this sync — don't bypass.
- Resend webhook deployment status: live, signing secret set, tested 400 + 401 paths
- Welcome email pipeline live on `dodo-webhook` Edge Function (ADR-017) — first paying customer post-`RESEND_API_KEY` setup gets brand-voiced welcome automatically
- Skill is at v1.1.0 — process changes already encoded (no option pickers, proactive close, this log file)

**Google Play onboarding email content (received May 10, 4:47PM SAST):**
From: Google Play | Apps & Games — "Quantum Neuro Creations, your launch journey starts here"
Three steps outlined:
1. Test early and often — internal tests + 14-day closed test with min 12 users
2. Build secure + transparent — Play Integrity API + complete data safety form
3. Comply and stay in control — follow Play Developer policy, use managed publishing
⚠️ Warning in email: "Don't forget to verify your account to maintain your Console access" — identity verification still pending, this is the main blocker for everything.

**End of session additions:**
- PLAY_STORE_PREP.md updated with Section 13 (policy audit) + Section 14 (Play Console tools)
- Full Google Play Policy Center audit completed — all categories checked, 4 small gaps added to checklist
- Deep link verification + crash deobfuscation added as pre-launch steps
- Vault has everything. All committed and pushed.

**🚀 MONDAY PLAN:**
1. Boot — check email for Google identity verification
2. Once verified → Create app in Play Console → upload AAB → internal test track live within minutes
3. Team meeting → recruit 12 testers → share opt-in link → 14-day closed test clock starts
4. While waiting on 14 days → entertainment disclaimer commit → store listing copy → screenshots → data safety form → app content declarations (health, AI, ads, no news)
5. After 14 days → request production access → submit
